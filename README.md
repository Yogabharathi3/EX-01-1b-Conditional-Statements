## AIM:
Write a C program to read A values and check whether  A is positive number or not.
## ALGORITHM:
1.Declare a variable to store the input value A.
2.Use the scanf function to read the value of A from the user.
3.Check if the value of A is greater than zero.
4.If A is greater than zero, print a message indicating that it's a positive number. 
5.Otherwise, print a message indicating that it's not a positive number.
6.End the program.
## PROGRAM:
```
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a;
    scanf("%d",&a);
    if (a>0)
    {
        printf("a is positive number");
    }
 return 0;   
}
```

## RESULT:
Thus the program to read A values and check whether  A is positive number or not has been executed successfully.
